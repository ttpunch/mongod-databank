# Guide to Push Your Project to GitHub

This guide will walk you through the process of pushing your MongoDB Excel Data API project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- Git is already installed and initialized in your project (âœ“)
- GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Git commands

## Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., "mongodb-excel-data-api")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since your project already has these files)
7. Click 'Create repository'

### 2. Add the Remote Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the repository URL. Copy it and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME` with the name you gave your repository.

### 3. Push Your Code to GitHub

Now you can push your code to the GitHub repository:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

This command pushes your commits to the remote repository and sets up tracking between your local 'main' branch and the remote 'main' branch.

### 4. Verify the Push

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and commit history there

### Pushing Updates in the Future

After making changes to your code, follow these steps to push updates:

1. Stage your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of the changes"
   ```

3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

### Managing Branches

To create and push a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push -u origin new-branch-name
```

### Handling Authentication

If you're prompted for credentials when pushing to GitHub, you can:

1. Use a Personal Access Token (recommended)
2. Set up SSH keys for secure authentication
3. Use GitHub CLI for easier authentication

Refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication) for detailed instructions on authentication methods.
